Airsend allows you to share files  of any size securely with co-workers, friends & family, to anywhere on the planet. With Airsend, you can share files regardless of what device you & the recipient uses, as well as regardless of how far away on the Earth you might be.

Airsend only acts as an intermediary of the peer-to-peer connection & NEVER stores any information related to files sent over Airsend.

## How does it work?

There are two modes, network mode & global mode.

**Network mode:** People on your network are shown, for easy discovery

**Global mode:** People on the whole planet are shown, and you are able to send files to anyone no matter how far away they might be.

## Features

- Secure
- No filesize limits
- No loss of quality
